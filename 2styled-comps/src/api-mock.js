The healing process could be accomplished through a number of different methods, but it is essentially bonding together two existing parts of one material.", "opportunities":"<li>Self-healing materials/composites will have a major impact in the near future, especially for materials such as underwater piping, or even aerospace structures, where maintenance and inspection are nearly impossible due to inaccessibility. With self-healing capabilities, there would be no concerns over issues such as erosion or microcracking.</li><li>Due to the autonomous nature, this solution could lead to facilities with just a few staff members to keep things running.</li>", "challenges":"<li>Research is still underway, but there are a variety of materials, including metals, cotton, leather, ceramics, concrete, and polymers, with self-healing potential. At first, these materials may be a luxury.</li><li>With self-healing capabilities, there would be concerns regarding stimulation when erosion or microcracking occurs. Scientists still need to find a balance for materials to \"heal\" by biomimicking skin processes.</li>"},
